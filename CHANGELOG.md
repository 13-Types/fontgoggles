# Changelog for FontGoggles

## [0.9.1] - 2020-02-19

- Reordering of fonts in the font list is now possible through drag and drop. One can also drag fonts to other FontGoggles windows, and to other applications.
- Renamed “Size” slider to “Relative Size”, to make it clearer this is about the size relative to the font list item. Normal zooming is done with pinch gestures, command minus and plus, and option scroll.
- Misc copyright updates.

## [0.9.0] - 2020-02-17

First public release.
